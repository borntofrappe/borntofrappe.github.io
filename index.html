      <p>I'm a fledging web developer with hopefully something to give.</p>
      <p>
        It all started with <a href="#">freeCodeCamp</a>, where I completed
        countless challenges and numerous certifications. On
        <a href="#">Codepen</a>, I found an exciting community to level up my
        skills, while on <a href="#">Github</a>, I tried to document every
        project longer than a single line code.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a
        <a href="#">Twitter</a> account, and while I took a break from the
        platform, I find it quite valuable to keep myself accountable and be
        inspired by awesome people.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a <a href="#">website</a> as well. If you are really interested
        in me, that's the best place to start.
