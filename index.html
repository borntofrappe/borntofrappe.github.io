I've been reading news from continental France for quite some time, to the point where I can comprehend and even describe most articles. There is however an entire vocabulary which eludes me. Familiar dialogue. Words, expressions, perhaps less intentional than those cherry-picked for the written press, used freely, born out of instinct and the difficult to experience reality which comes from just living locally.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBarring a move to a not-so-distant border, a way to tap into the vernacular is through different media. Books, movies, podcasts, streamers broadcasting their daily endeavors. And yes, games. Watching people enjoy games, through ups and downs, through the impact of a heart-felt cut-scene, through the tension and reward from a hard-fought battle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EBon! on y va, non?\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJumping straight into a stream might work, but is similar to dive-bombing into the sea just having learnt how to dog paddle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA couple of tests lead me to believe that French people are quite fond of being quick-witted, jamming three words where you'd think only two would fit. While I do appreciate the efficiency, this tendency makes it easy to lose your bearing, even in a short conversation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt helps to have a leg up. In this instance, it helps to experience the games first-hand. In tongue, most assuredly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might believe this a convoluted, long-winded excuse to waste more time playing games, but honestly that is a delightful added bonus.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe intent is to soften a steep learning curve, much like a CSS transition smoothes changes with a thoughtful timing function. And what better curve than an ease-in function, starting slowly with a title I already completed in its anglophone variant?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENot a better pretext to dive back into the pixelated marvel which is Pokemon Red, err Pokemon Rouge.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EFound in translation\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBeing a role-playing game, you can enjoy the Game Boy gem at your own pace, you are able to digest every line of dialogue with the help of a quick lookup online.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBeing a rather popular game, there is no shortage of material in video form.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBeing a game actually finished more times than I care to admit, I can personally find correspondence with the English dialogue, and enjoy the idiosyncrasies baked by the translating team as they try to adapt to the adventure to the local audience.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the exploration of the luxury cruise liner S.S. Anne in Pokemon Red, for instance, you meet a young lady confounding you for a waiter and asking for a specific sweet.

Curious.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA few steps later, in the kitchen hold of the same ship, the cook proposes one of three menus, described if you ask enough times to compensate for randomness. While the options do not change radically — prime beef steak becomes \u003Cem\u003Ecotes de boeuf\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, eels au barbeque turns into \u003Cem\u003Epates d'anguilles\u003C\u002Fem\u003E and salmon du salad literally morphs into to \u003Cem\u003Esalade de saumon\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, it is intriguing to see the comment for each entry — especially for the last, vegetable-based entree.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn Shakespeare's tongue \u003Cem\u003ELes guests may gripe it's fish again\u003C\u002Fem\u003E.

Twice the number in each direction, four times the number of pixels.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could make a case that some of these pixels are not actually used, after all the images are in \u003Ccode\u003E.png\u003C\u002Fcode\u003E format, allowing for transparency, but you get the gist.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003C!-- ![Spritesheet with 11 sprites](\u002Fimages\u002Fspritesheet-16.png) --\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E11 sprites, 16 by 16, Enough to make your head spin.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EUse case\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the time of writing, there is no point to the spritesheet.
