description: Here's a folder devoted to useful resources. Pixelated pictures for upcoming titles?

I decided to create a folder in the repository housing this very website. A directory purposed for, surpise surpise, pixel art. The first assets have quite a distinct appeal â€” you might have guessed it by the style of the entire app.

I am particularly proud of three of them, combined and animated in a nice long strip. Unfortunately, you'll spot the visual only if you go looking for a page that does not exist. The irony. Just for once, however, I'll tip you to it, try looking for pages such as [this one](/a-definitely-missing-page).
