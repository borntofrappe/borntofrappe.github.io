What's 5196?

One more than 5195? Most assuredly.

The number of feet it takes to walk a mile? Not quite, although you could make the argument for a different feet length.

The PIN number I forgot and barred me from using my phone for a rather unnerving set of 24 hours? Perhaps this last option was too specific to be off-base.

Am I afraid of revealing the precious set of digits out and about? Not really, and I'd rather look at the upside of having a page with the right answer. And who knows, I might have been forced to change the supposedly secure quartet in the end. To 5195? Too obvious.
