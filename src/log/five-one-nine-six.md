What's 5196?

One more than 5195? Most assuredly.

The number of feet it takes to walk a mile? That would be coincidental, if at all true.

The PIN number I forgot and locked me out of my phone for a rather unnerving set of 24 hours, stranded in a small mountainous village in the Swiss Alps, thankfully comforted by a heart-warming wooden stove? Perhaps this last option was too specific to be a mislead.

Am I afraid of shouting such a precious collection of digits out and about? Not really, and I'd rather look at the upside of having a page with the right answer. You always need access to that small rectangular piece of glass. And who knows, I might have been forced to change the supposedly secure quartet in the end. To 5195? Too obvious. 5280? That would be silly.
