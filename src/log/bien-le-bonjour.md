One of the skills I intend to master relates to the French language. I've been reading news from continental France for quite some time, to the point where I can comprehend and even describe most articles. There is however an entire vocabulary which eludes me. Familiar dialogue. Words, expressions, perhaps less intentional than those cherry-picked for the written press, used freely, born out of instinct and the difficult to experience reality which comes from just living locally.

Barring a move to a not-so-distant border, a way to tap into the vernacular is through different media. Books, movies, podcasts, streamers broadcasting their daily endeavors. And yes, games. Watching people enjoy games, through ups and downs, through the impact of a heart-felt cut-scene, through the tension and reward from a hard-fought battle.

## Bon! on y va, non?

Jumping straight into a stream might work, but is similar to dive-bombing into the sea just having learnt how to dog paddle.

A couple of tests lead me to believe that French people are quite fond of being quick-witted, jamming three words where you'd think only two would fit. While I do appreciate the efficiency, this tendency makes it easy to lose your bearing, even in a short conversation.

It helps to have a leg up. In this instance, it helps to experience the games first-hand. In tongue, most assuredly.

You might believe this a convoluted, long-winded excuse to waste more time playing games, but honestly that is a delightful added bonus.

The intent is to soften a steep learning curve, much like a CSS transition smoothes changes with a thoughtful timing function. And what better curve than an ease-in function, starting slowly with a title I already completed in its anglophone variant?

Not a better pretext to dive back into the pixelated marvel which is Pokemon Red, err Pokemon Rouge.

## Found in translation

Being a role-playing game, you can enjoy the Game Boy gem at your own pace, you are able to digest every line of dialogue with the help of a quick lookup online.

Being a rather popular game, there is no shortage of material in video form.

Being a game actually finished more times than I care to admit, I can personally find correspondence with the English dialogue, and enjoy the idiosyncrasies baked by the translating team as they try to adapt to the adventure to the local audience.

In the exploration of the luxury cruise liner S.S. Anne in Pokemon Red, for instance, you meet a young lady confounding you for a waiter and asking for a specific sweet. On one side of the ocean this is a cherry pie, but in the opposing continent the dessert becomes _une tarte aux poires_. Curious.

A few steps later, in the kitchen hold of the same ship, the cook proposes one of three menus, described if you ask enough times to compensate for randomness. While the options do not change radically — prime beef steak becomes _cotes de boeuf_, eels au barbeque turns into _pates d'anguilles_ and salmon du salad literally morphs into to _salade de saumon_, it is intriguing to see the comment for each entry — especially for the last, vegetable-based entree.

In Shakespeare's tongue _Les guests may gripe it's fish again_. Dans la langue de Molière, on the other hand, _Pour ceux qui ne sont pas content, c'est la meme chose!_.

I'll leave to you the homework of typing these words in a translator, and delight in the accompanying humor.

Entertaining enough to be memorable.
