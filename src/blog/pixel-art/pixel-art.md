This website has an undeniable preference for 2D sprites. Of course you won't notice this without CSS, but let's assume you are seeing the results of the stylesheet manicured just for you.

Let's assume you notice the art at the bottom of the page.

Well, today I've decided to tinker with more pixel art. What is more, I've dared to level up and go from a 8 pixel canvas to a 16 pixels one. Twice the number in each directions, four times the number of pixels.

You could make a case that some of these pixels are not actually used, after all the images are in `.png` format, allowing for transparency, but you get the gist.

[Spritesheet with 11 sprites](./spritesheet.png).

11 sprites, 16 by 16, Enough to make your head spin.

## Use case

At the time of writing, there is no point to the stylesheet. There are a few leads, however. The star, moon and, let's assume you're convinced the third sprite looks like a sun, could make for a toggle between themes. The map is perfect to describe the position in the website, and the widget right next to it might introduce a menu rather convincingly.

The compass is perhaps the most versatile, for a loader, a timeout. It might need more frames, though.

There are still five in the, admittedly small, sheet, but I'll let you figure out your favorite on your own â€” I got my own.
