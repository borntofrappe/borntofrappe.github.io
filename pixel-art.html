	<!-- HTML_TAG_START --><p>This website has an undeniable preference for 2D sprites. Of course you won't notice this without CSS, but let's assume you are seeing the results of the stylesheet manicured just for you.</p>
<p>Let's assume you did notice the art at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>Well, I've decided to tinker once more with pixel art. Not only that, I've dared to level up and go from a 8 pixel canvas to a 16 pixel one. Twice the number in each direction, four times the number of pixels.</p>
<p>You could make a case that some of these pixels are not actually used, after all the images are in <code>.png</code> format, allowing for transparency, but you get the gist.</p>
<p><img src="/images/spritesheet-16.png" alt="Spritesheet with 11 sprites"></p>
<p>11 sprites, 16 by 16, Enough to make your head spin.</p>
<h2>Use case</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, there is no point to the spritesheet. There are a few leads, however. The star, moon and, let's pretend you're convinced the third sprite from the left looks like a sun, could make for a toggle between themes — not that I would implement the feature just yet.</p>
<p>The map is perfect to describe the position in the website, and the cog right next to it might introduce a menu rather convincingly.</p>
<p>The compass is perhaps the most versatile, for a loader, a timeout. It could use a few more frames to animate the visual, though.</p>
<p>There are still five in the, admittedly small, sheet, but I'll let you figure out your favorite on your own — I've got my own.</p>

I've been reading news from continental France for quite some time, to the point where I can comprehend and even describe most articles. There is however an entire vocabulary which eludes me. Familiar dialogue. Words, expressions, perhaps less intentional than those cherry-picked for the written press, used freely, born out of instinct and the difficult to experience reality which comes from just living locally.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBarring a move to a not-so-distant border, a way to tap into the vernacular is through different media. Books, movies, podcasts, streamers broadcasting their daily endeavors. And yes, games. Watching people enjoy games, through ups and downs, through the impact of a heart-felt cut-scene, through the tension and reward from a hard-fought battle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EBon! on y va, non?\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJumping straight into a stream might work, but is similar to dive-bombing into the sea just having learnt how to dog paddle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA couple of tests lead me to believe that French people are quite fond of being quick-witted, jamming three words where you'd think only two would fit. While I do appreciate the efficiency, this tendency makes it easy to lose your bearing, even in a short conversation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt helps to have a leg up.

In tongue, most assuredly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might believe this a convoluted, long-winded excuse to waste more time playing games, but honestly that is a delightful added bonus.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe intent is to soften a steep learning curve, much like a CSS transition eases changes with a thoughtful timing function.

Anne in Pokemon Red, for instance, you meet a young lady confounding you for a waiter and asking for a specific sweet.
