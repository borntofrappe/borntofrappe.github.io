## Hello There

<!-- please note, this readme was re-initialized on the 4th of September, to refactor and refresh the website -->

Welcome to the repository hosting, discussing and ever updating my personal website.

## Roadmap

What I'd like to include in the span of weeks:

- [ ] new tab icon;

- [ ] better copy;

- [ ] more visuals for large viewports

As a overarching effort, but as a more general sentiment as well, I'd like to also go through the codebase and refactor it/ improve it where needed. As I am always learning, I am sure to find grounds for improvements.
