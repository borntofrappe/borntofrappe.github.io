# Hello There

This repository is used to create and update my personal portfolio page. In its current version, the [site](https://borntofrappe.github.io/) is hosted on github pages and provides a static web-page. 

The static website is set to contain information regarding my current technology stack and few of the projects I built with said technology stack. Moreover, it should also contain a section devoted to social icons, referring to github/ freecodecamp/ twitter accounts to get into contact with the author, aka moi.

Ultimately, and for now, I consider it a sweet place in which to showcase such static information, but later on, I might be tempted to incorporate additional features.

## Versions 

The website as visualized in the previous chapter is built in manageable steps.

V1: include a navigation bar which is fixed to the top of the page and primed for mobile devices.

V2: include a welcome section right below the navigation bar.

V3: include a section displaying the technology stack, through SVG icons.

V4: prior to the section devoted on showcasing a few projects (for which I want to spend some time), include a section with social icons

V4.5: re-consider the markup and style for the project, with the intention of creating understandable, readable, not-too-often-repeated code.
