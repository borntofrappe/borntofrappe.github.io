# Welcome Page

> repo gathering the resouces making up my [personal website](https://borntofrappe.github.io/)

## Roadmap

> Short to mid-term goals

- [ ] add a simple animation atop the page, in the form of an airplane passing by every so often (perhaps only for smaller viewports where there is quite a bit of white space atop the application).

- [ ] consider re-designing the icon for styled-components. Consider new icons for the upcoming back end projects.

- [ ] in the bottom of the page detail a simple drawing application through the canvas element.
