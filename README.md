# Hello There

This repository is used to create and update my personal portfolio page. In its current version, the [site](https://borntofrappe.github.io/) is hosted on github pages and provides a static web-page. This static website contains information regarding my current stack and few of the projects I built up to now.

Ultimately, and for now, I consider it a sweet place in which to showcase such static information, but later on, I might be tempted to incorporate additional features.
