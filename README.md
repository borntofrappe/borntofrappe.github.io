## Issues

> Pressing matters

- [ ] due to a bug in firefox, setting an explicit width and heihgt attribute on the SVG as they are defined causes cropping when the SVG is then used with different (smaller) sizes. Remove said attributes.

- [ ] in microsoft edge, which didn't seem to give me issues a while back, it appears the page doesn' render the color. I don't know if there's something with custom properties or an outdated version of Edge. More analysis is warranted.

## Roadmap

> Short to mid-term goals

- [ ] add a simple animation atop the page, in the form of an airplane passing by every so often (perhaps only for smaller viewports where there is quite a bit of white space atop the application).

- [ ] consider re-designing the icon for styled-components. Consider new icons for the upcoming back end projects.

- [ ] in the bottom of the page detail a simple drawing application through the canvas element.
