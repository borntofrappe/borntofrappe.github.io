## Preface

I want to implement a new version of my personal website, at least my personal website as available through Github Pages. The previous one was a rather proud result, involving quite a lot of care not only in the mobile-first layout, but also the design of beautiful icons and a slick navigation bar.

Alas, it was also rather conformant to a standard, default portfolio page. Most importantly, it was also plagued by the following critical issues:

- the black and white motif was sure accommodating for grayscale devices, but I'm willing to admit that most web users benefit from color-filled screens. In this context, the website admittedly was rather dull;

- the simple layout and bare-bone sections were excellent for smaller viewports, but rendered a rather sparse and deserted stucture for larger devices. While I've considered adding decorations here and there, this forced me to question what to actually include in the page, and with what king of granularity. Which brings me to the next point;

- the section dedicated to the technology stack served very little purpose. I did spend a lot of time designing every single icon in an SVG format. The circular pattern was also rather pleasing to the eyes. But those are not valid grounds for the fundamental issue just introduced.

All together, this considerations brought me to distill the following guiding principles:

- colorful, while maintaining enough contrast to sustain grayscale devices;

- informative, serving a purpose for the visitor more than for the designer;

- neat. While function is a central theme in this re-write, I do not go back on a simple belief I have regarding web pages, that they should be neat. Be it a simple, miniscule animation, or a detail only a couple of people get to admire, there should be small surprises and visuals somebody gets to see only by accident, or on a second visit.

For the stack, I want to keep it simple: HTML markup, CSS unprocessed stylesheet, possibly JS script to add some kind of dynamism.

For the content of the page, a bit more attention and consideration is warranted. A hypothetical structure can be jotted down from the point of view of an eventual, hopeful visitor. Somebody reaching the site and going through the following queries:

- who is this character?

- why should I care?

- (hopefully interested) how can I reach him?

Of course, this journey might actually boil down to the following path (which I believe to be far more likely):

- who this?

- uh, neat.

- leaves...

Either way, and trying not to get discouraged by actual facts, the page ought to first and foremost inform the visitor, in a neat looking package.

Inform the visitor on the personality behind the web page and the projects he's created so far. I want to maintain the colloquial, informal tone, but most importantly, I want to here consider the best way to showcase one's own project.
