# FAQ

## What's this?

A hub for a front-end web developer. Currently, it redirects toward the places in which I spend most of my time and energy:

- codepen

- freecodecamp

- github

- twitter

## That's it?

That's never it. I'm working on a considerably larger website, which even includes a blog, but this is a perfect place to experiment with a different stack, SVG syntax and CSS animation.
