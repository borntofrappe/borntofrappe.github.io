## Roadmap

> Short to mid-term goals

- [ ] update the project's icon, title and description to match the content of the page;

- [ ] consider adding a simple animation atop the picture. Especially and perhaps only for smaller viewports (where the picture is prefaced by quite a lot of space. On purpose, I might add).

- [ ] include new values in the array nesting possible job descriptions.

- [ ] write better copy for the project section, specifically for the description of each project (although the icons need to also be updated as to relate the technology behind each effort).

- [ ] new icons for the technology stack. Consider for instance **MongoDB**, **Mongoose** for the back end, **Redux** for the front end.

- [ ] more descriptive text for anchor link and button element.

- [ ] consider changing the icon, from a simple div modified through the `border-radius` property to an SVG shape.

- [ ] consider adding other profiles. Mail, linkedin (although this last one is close to defunct, at least personallly).

- [ ] detail a simple section closing the page, as a treat for having reached the end of the same. Consider for instance a simple canvas element, in which visitors can draw anything they fancy with a pencil or perhaps a paintbrush. Consider an equally elementary game. Maybe both.

- [ ] get to work on new projects!
